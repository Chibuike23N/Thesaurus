I	once	heard	the	tale	of	a	good	man,	the	Claws	of	Santa.	They	say	the	Claws	of	Santa	lived	in	the	frigid,	desolate	wastelands	north	of	the	maple	people.	His	static	lair,	standing	in	stark	defiance	of	an	angry	world.	In	spite	of	the	ceaseless	noise	of	a	raging	populace,	tearing	away	at	the	sanity	of	mere	mortals	like	interference	evaporating	the	image	of	happy	days	long	gone,	his	mind	is	transparent;	his	resolve	unshaken.	Lo,	he	even	finds	time	to	bring	justice	to	the	most	terrifying	of	creature	known	to	humanity:	children.	The	wicked,	the	awful,	he	judges	them	all.	With	the	gift	of	mercy	to	the	kind,	and	no	such	boon	to	the	malevolent.	And	as	he	metes	out	his	justice	most	great	and	foul,	he	laughs.	His	portly	frame	shaking	like	a	huge	bowl	of	sweetened	hoof	distillate.	By	the	way,	I	certainly	hope	nobody	is	actually	bothering	to	read	this	nonsense;	it	is	just	a	bunch	of	filler.
